📚 The Vocabulary Trainer is a tool that helps you learn and practice vocabulary in a fun and interactive way. 🎉

📂 The app lets you upload vocabulary lists from CSV files (two columns: target lang, translation) and then choose a list to practice with. 📝

🔀 A randomly selected word from the list is shown to you and you have to choose between 4️⃣ options the correct translation. 🌐

📊 There's also a scoreboard that lets you know how many correct/incorrect answers you have had in the practice and the percentage of accuracy. ✅❌
