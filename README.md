The Vocabulary Trainer is a tool that helps you learn and practice vocabulary in a fun and interactive way.

The app lets you upload vocabulary lists from **CSV** files (two columns: target lang, translation) and then choose a list to practice with.

A randomly selected word from the list is shown to you and you have to choose between 4 options the correct translation.

There's also a scoreboard that lets you know how many correct/incorrect answers you have had in the practice and the percentage of accuracy.
